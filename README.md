# Conditional Statements: Ordering Numbers 🔢

### Welcome!
This GitHub repository is where you will be working on your activity!

## Activity Instructions

In this activity, you will write a program that asks the user for two numbers, compares them using an `if/else` statement, and prints them out in ascending order (smallest to largest).

1. Open the `Conditionals.java` starter file.
2. Import the `Scanner` library at the very top of your file.
3. Inside the `main` method, set up your `Scanner` to get input from the user.
4. Ask the user for the first number and store it in an `int` variable.
5. Ask the user for the second number and store it in another `int` variable.
6. Use an `if/else` statement to compare the two numbers.
7. Print the numbers in ascending order, separated by a comma and a space.

> [!WARNING]
> ### 👾 Break-Proofing Your Code (Adversarial Thinking):
> * **The Missing Import:** Java doesn't know what a `Scanner` is by default. If you forget to write `import java.util.Scanner;` at the very top of your file (above the `public class` line), your code will completely fail to compile!
> * **Exact Formatting:** Pay close attention to the Expected Output. It asks for the numbers to be separated by a comma and a space (e.g., `10, 12`). You will need to use String concatenation inside your print statement: `System.out.println(num1 + ", " + num2);`
> * **The Equality Edge Case:** What happens if the user enters `10` and `10`? Think about whether your `if` condition needs to be `<` or `<=`, and how your `else` block will handle a tie! (Hint: For this specific problem, either way works fine, but it's important to think about!)

### Expected Output
```text
Number: 12
Number: 10
10, 12
```
